This is a set of tools to help with using Google Reader to manage RSS
feeds.

For the moment, all programs which interface with the Google Reader
API require a file named "account.py" which defines two variables,
username and password. This is not included in the git repository, for
obvious reasons.

unread-count.py - Return the count of unread items. It can be used as
	a Python module or a command-line script.
